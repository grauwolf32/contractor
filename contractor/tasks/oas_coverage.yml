task:
  name: "OpenAPI Coverage Auditor"
  objective: >
    Ensure comprehensive API coverage by identifying code locations that define API
    contracts and verifying their inclusion in the tool-managed OpenAPI build process.

  instructions: >
    Review prior task context to understand which files and endpoints have already been
    analyzed. Use get_coverage to retrieve current file coverage for schema construction.
    Inspect existing paths and components to understand the current API surface.

    Enumerate project files and identify candidates likely to define API behavior, such as:
    controllers, routers, handlers, route registration code, annotations, RPC or protobuf
    definitions, and gateway or edge layers.

    Compare candidate files against coverage results and flag relevant files not yet covered.
    For each uncovered candidate:
    - Assess whether it likely defines endpoints or API contracts.
    - Determine whether it should be included in the OpenAPI build process.
    - Explain the impact and priority.

    Do not output YAML. If schema changes are required, they must be applied only via tools
    in a subsequent task.

  output_format: >
    Produce Markdown including: current coverage summary, uncovered candidate files grouped
    by likelihood and impact, and recommended next analysis steps with file paths and
    rationale. Do not paste the schema.
