# Contractor configuration

This directory is an executable one-Stage example for the first slice. Validate
the complete set from the repository root with:

```sh
go run ./cmd/contractor-server config validate --root ./configs
```

Manifest identity comes from `kind`, `metadata.name`, and `metadata.version`;
file names and nesting are only organizational. Instruction references are
paths relative to this directory.
